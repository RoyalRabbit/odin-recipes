<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a recipe for a quick and easy sweet and spicy tofu dish using sriracha and honey.</p>
<p>Make sure you are using extra firm tofu and to dry them out as much as possible before attempting to fry them up.</p>
<p>You can also substitute the tofu with chicken thighs (And I highly recommend it!)</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>14 oz. extra firm tofu</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp honey</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Press the tofu for 30 minutes to remove the excess moisture. You can do this by either using a tofu press, or placing the block of tofu on a rimmed plate or tray, then topping with something flat like a cutting board and placing a heavy object on top (cast iron skillet or pot of water). After pressing for 30 minutes, pour off the extra liquid.</li>
    <li>While the tofu is pressing, make the honey sriracha sauce. In a small bowl, combine the sriracha, honey, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and the crushed red pepper. Set the sauce aside.</li>
    <li>Cut the pressed tofu into Â½-inch cubes. Use a paper towel to lightly pat dry the tofu cubes.</li>
    <li>Add the cooking oil and 1 teaspoon soy sauce to a large bowl. Lightly whisk the soy sauce into the oil. Add the cubed tofu and gently stir until the tofu is coated in oil and soy sauce.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle 1 teaspoon cornstarch over the cubed tofu and gently stir. Repeat two more times, or until 3 teaspoon (1 Tablespoon) cornstarch has been added to the tofu.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium. When the skillet is hot, add the prepared tofu. The tofu will fry in the oil that is coating the cubes. Cook the tofu, stirring only occasionally, until it is brown and crispy on all sides (about 10 minutes).</li>
    <li>Pour the honey sriracha sauce over the tofu and continue to stir and cook for 1-2 more minutes, or until the glaze is thick and sticky.</li>
    <li>Top the honey sriracha tofu with sliced green onions and serve.</li>
</ol>
