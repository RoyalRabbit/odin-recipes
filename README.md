# odin-recipes
Recipe Project

This will be the first basic website creating a list of recipes to cook using just HTML knowledge.

This project will include images, links, lists, paragraphs, and headers to organize recipes into common household items
and those that may need to be sourced at a grocery market.

This will also practice writing commit messages to be clear and concise.
